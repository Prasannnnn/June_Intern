Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify chemical substances by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It involves ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged particles (ions) and sorting them in electric and magnetic fields according to their mass-to-charge ratios. The results are presented as a mass spectrum, which is a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. This technique is widely used in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science, to analyze the composition and structure of molecules.
